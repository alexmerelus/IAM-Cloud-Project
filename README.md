## Day 1: Setting Up the Environment 🚀

### Introduction

Today marked the beginning of my journey with the Cloud Resume Challenge. The primary focus was to get acquainted with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and set up the foundational elements.

### Goals Achieved 🎯

1. **IAM User Setup**: Successfully set up an IAM user with programmatic access.

2. **IAM Policy Creation**: Created a custom policy for accessing specific AWS services.
    - (insert screenshot of policy here)
3. **Secure Key Management**: Ensured that access keys were stored securely and not hard-coded.
    - (insert screenshot of key management tool or method here)
4. **Initial Project Setup**: Initialized a new repository on GitHub to track progress.

### Challenges Faced 🤔

While the day was productive, I faced a few challenges:
- Understanding the difference between AWS managed policies and customer managed policies.
- Ensuring that the IAM user had the least privilege necessary for the tasks.

### Learnings 📘

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Learned about the importance of granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
- **IAM Best Practices**: Got familiar with AWS recommendations for securing IAM resources.

### Next Steps 🐾

- Dive deeper into more advanced IAM configurations.
- Start integrating AWS services using the permissions set up today.
