## Day 1: Setting Up the Environment

### Introduction

Today marked the beginning of my journey with the Cloud Resume Challenge. The primary focus was to get acquainted with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and set up the foundational elements.

### Goals Achieved üéØ

1. **IAM User ![CR-IAG_App User Success](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/7e7cb4fe-1d95-4382-b779-c8a2bf7ec72d)
Setup**: Successfully set up an IAM user with programmatic access. 
    
2. **IAM Policy Creation in JSON Format**: Created a custom policy for accessing specific AWS services.
![JSON Policy Filled](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/907f2056-6300-4353-a54e-813a14d619ac)


3. **Created S3 Bucket for static website**: Ensured S3 Bucket was created to host resume on AWS S3 with CloudFront

4. **Initial AWS CLI Setup**: Initialized AWS CLI to later sync AWS S3.

### Challenges Faced ü§î

While the day was productive, I faced a few challenges:
- Understanding the difference between AWS managed policies and customer managed policies.
- Ensuring that the IAM user had the least privilege necessary for the tasks.

### Learnings üìò

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Learned about the importance of granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
- **IAM Best Practices**: Got familiar with AWS recommendations for securing IAM resources.

### Next Steps üêæ

- Dive deeper into more advanced IAM configurations.
- Start integrating AWS services using the permissions set up today.

## Day 2: Configuring IAMüåê

---

#### **Introduction** üìú

On the second day of the Cloud Resume Challenge, my focus shifted to a deeper exploration of AWS's IAM (Identity and Access Management) and setting up the crucial backend components for the serverless application.

---

#### **IAM - The Heart of AWS Security** üîê

IAM allows me to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Today, I used it to create and manage AWS users and groups, and used permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

**Policy Simulator** üïπÔ∏è:
The AWS Policy Simulator is a tool to help you understand, test, and validate the effects of your access control policies. I was able to use this to simulate and validate the IAM policies, ensuring they grant permissions as intended.

![Policy Simulator Success](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/fdda4262-2f44-41d5-bd7d-65f56e6ddd2f)

#### **Setting Up the Backend** üíª

The backend of our application is crucial as it's responsible for the logic that increments and displays the visit count.

**Lambda Integration with API Gateway** üö™:
Lambda lets me run code without provisioning or managing servers. I integrated Lambda with API Gateway to trigger my function each time the API endpoint is hit. This allows me to execute the visit counter logic.

![Lambda Function code](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/6f8f6e94-ad01-4e9e-868d-31992a7a76a6)


**CloudResumelAG-EC2Role Setup** üõ†Ô∏è:
Roles in AWS allow services to interact with resources without the use of security credentials. I set up the `CloudResumelAG-EC2Role` to grant specific permissions to our resources, ensuring the application components can communicate effectively.

![CR-IAG_EC2Role Review ](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/128b39f6-b6cc-418b-b86e-cfaffe2bc480)


---

#### **Conclusion** üåü

Day 2 was all about setting a strong foundation for the application's security and backend logic. Through IAM, I made sure I secured environment, and with Lambda and API Gateway, I'm now ready to handle and display the website's visits.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue our journey into the Cloud Resume Challenge!

Looking forward to Day 3, for frontend integration and more! üöÄüîç

## Day 3: Integrating with Lambda and API Gateway

**"Decoding the IAM Project: A Deep Dive into AWS Cloud Resume's Visitor Counter"**

üå•Ô∏è Today, I'm peeling back the layers of the IAM project I've been working on for my AWS cloud resume. If you've been curious about how Im trying to display a visit count on the index page of my website, grab a coffee ‚òï and let's delve right in!

### 1. **Integration with DynamoDB**:
Our first player in this game is DynamoDB - Amazon's managed NoSQL database service. Specifically, I set up a table named 'ResumeVisitCounter' for this.

### 2. **The Aim of the Game**:
So, what‚Äôs this function all about? Simply put, it‚Äôs a fancy visit tracker for my resume site. Every time someone checks out my site, this function makes sure it's noted.

### 3. **How's it Work?**:
- First up, every time the function‚Äôs called upon, it makes a change in our DynamoDB table.
- The item that gets the update? It's the one labeled 'SiteName' and specifically the 'ResumeSite' value.
- And the change? Well, it ups the 'VisitCount' by one, counting every awesome person (like you) who drops by!

### 4. **And the Crowd Goes...**:
After adding to the count, the function doesn't keep it a secret. It fetches the new count and crafts a response to show the new number. Think of it as a virtual pat on the back, acknowledging your visit in the form of a 200 status code and a JSON response.

### 5. **The Grand Scheme of Things**:
Now, if you're thinking, "How does this all fit together?", here's the deal:
- Imagine every time someone lands on my resume page, this function gets a nudge via maybe an API Gateway.
- It then does its magic, keeping the numbers in DynamoDB so we never lose count, even if it's the millionth visit (a guy can dream, right?).

üîç **A Little Side Note**:
While everything sounds cool, I've run into a teeny problem. There's this Decimal to JSON serialization hiccup in Lambda. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Decimal, straight from the database, and JSON don't wwant to work together. 

But hey, every challenge is an opportunity and I've been brainstorming some fixes:

- **Option 1**: Ditch Lambda for a Python script on EC2. Simple and neat.
- **Option 2**: Swap out DynamoDB for a buddy like PostgreSQL.
- **Option 3**: Pair up API Gateway and DynamoDB SDK. Get API Gateway to act as the mediator, transforming the Decimal before the JSON sees it.
- **Option 4**: Move the counting party to the front-end with JavaScript.
- **Option 5**: Create a counter microservice, bypassing the need for JSON altogether.

I'm still on the fence about which route to take. In any case, that‚Äôs my update for now and will be working on here and there over the next few days. üë®‚Äçüíª
