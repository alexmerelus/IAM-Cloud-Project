## Day 1: Setting Up the Environment

### Introduction

Today marked the beginning of my journey with the Cloud Resume Challenge. The primary focus was to get acquainted with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and set up the foundational elements.

### Goals Achieved 🎯

1. **IAM User ![CR-IAG_App User Success](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/7e7cb4fe-1d95-4382-b779-c8a2bf7ec72d)
Setup**: Successfully set up an IAM user with programmatic access. 
    
2. **IAM Policy Creation in JSON Format**: Created a custom policy for accessing specific AWS services.
![JSON Policy Filled](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/907f2056-6300-4353-a54e-813a14d619ac)


3. **Created S3 Bucket for static website**: Ensured S3 Bucket was created to host resume on AWS S3 with CloudFront

4. **Initial AWS CLI Setup**: Initialized AWS CLI to later sync AWS S3.

### Challenges Faced 🤔

While the day was productive, I faced a few challenges:
- Understanding the difference between AWS managed policies and customer managed policies.
- Ensuring that the IAM user had the least privilege necessary for the tasks.

### Learnings 📘

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Learned about the importance of granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
- **IAM Best Practices**: Got familiar with AWS recommendations for securing IAM resources.

### Next Steps 🐾

- Dive deeper into more advanced IAM configurations.
- Start integrating AWS services using the permissions set up today.

## Day 2: Configuring IAM🌐

---

#### **Introduction** 📜

On the second day of the Cloud Resume Challenge, my focus shifted to a deeper exploration of AWS's IAM (Identity and Access Management) and setting up the crucial backend components for the serverless application.

---

#### **IAM - The Heart of AWS Security** 🔐

IAM allows me to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Today, I used it to create and manage AWS users and groups, and used permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

**Policy Simulator** 🕹️:
The AWS Policy Simulator is a tool to help you understand, test, and validate the effects of your access control policies. I was able to use this to simulate and validate the IAM policies, ensuring they grant permissions as intended.

#### **Setting Up the Backend** 💻

The backend of our application is crucial as it's responsible for the logic that increments and displays the visit count.

**Lambda Integration with API Gateway** 🚪:
Lambda lets me run code without provisioning or managing servers. I integrated Lambda with API Gateway to trigger my function each time the API endpoint is hit. This allows me to execute the visit counter logic.

![Lambda Function code](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/6f8f6e94-ad01-4e9e-868d-31992a7a76a6)


**CloudResumelAG-EC2Role Setup** 🛠️:
Roles in AWS allow services to interact with resources without the use of security credentials. I set up the `CloudResumelAG-EC2Role` to grant specific permissions to our resources, ensuring the application components can communicate effectively.

![CR-IAG_EC2Role Review ](https://github.com/alexmerelus/IAM-Cloud-Project/assets/138509128/128b39f6-b6cc-418b-b86e-cfaffe2bc480)


---

#### **Conclusion** 🌟

Day 2 was all about setting a strong foundation for the application's security and backend logic. Through IAM, I made sure I secured environment, and with Lambda and API Gateway, I'm now ready to handle and display the website's visits.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue our journey into the Cloud Resume Challenge!

Looking forward to Day 3, for frontend integration and more! 🚀🔍

## Day 3: Integrating with Lambda and API Gateway

**"Decoding the IAM Project: A Deep Dive into AWS Cloud Resume's Visitor Counter"**

🌥️ Today, I'm peeling back the layers of the IAM project I've been working on for my AWS cloud resume. If you've been curious about how Im trying to display a visit count on the index page of my website, but it looks like this is going to be more complex that neccessary so im going to pivot to a different feature that still takes advantage of the Lambda and Api gateway. 

### 1. **Integration with DynamoDB**:
The first feature was the DynamoDB - Amazon's managed NoSQL database service. Specifically, I wanted to set up a table named 'ResumeVisitCounter' for this. This was designed to be a visit tracker for my resume site so that every time someone checks out my site, this function makes sure it's noted.

### 3. **How it 'supposed' to work?**:
Every time the function’s called upon, it should make a change in the DynamoDB table. The 'SiteName' gets updated and the 'ResumeSite' value is changed and each change increase the 'VisitCount' by one, counting every person who visits. So after adding to the count, the function fetches the new count and generates a response to show the new number, in the form of a 200 status code and a JSON response.

- Every time someone lands on my resume page, this function gets a notified by the API Gateway.
- Keeping the numbers in DynamoDB allows me to save the progress over time.

😑😑😑  **Pivoting**:
This felt like a great idea at the time but the way JSON and DynamoDB's number data type is setup, they dont recognize decimal types the same and it led to a serialization error when trying to convert a decimal directly to JSON. A decimal object, straight from the database to JSON format isnt possible.


🕹️ In an attempt to fully understand the issue myself, here's the best way to explain whats happeneing: 

Imagine playing a video game where you collect coins. In this game, the coins you collect can be regular whole numbers like 1, 2, 3, but sometimes, they have decimal values, like 1.5 or 2.75. The game system stores these coin values very precisely so that every player gets the exact amount they earned.

### Original Setup:

1. **The Game (DynamoDB)**: You're collecting coins, and the game keeps track.
2. **Sharing (Lambda)**: You want to tell your friends how many coins you have.
3. **Social Media (JSON)**: The place where you share your score.

### The Desired Outcome:

You want to share "I have 2.75 coins!" without any errors.

### The Problem:

Now, you want to share your coin score on social media. But there's a glitch! The social media platform can't understand these precise coin values. If you try to post "I have 2.75 coins!", the platform gets confused and shows an error.

### What's Actually Happening?

This problem is like what happens between DynamoDB (the database service by AWS) and the JSON format (a way to represent data). DynamoDB is like the game; it stores numbers very precisely. JSON is like the social media platform; it's getting confused with super precise numbers.

### The Fix:

I would need a translator to convert the game's coin values into something the social media platform understands. This tool would make sure that when I say "I have 2.75 coins!", the platform gets it and doesn't show an error.

This added a layer of complexity that I did not anticipate and didnt know how to address without sacrificing functionality, so ive decided to list alternate options:

- **Option 1**: Ditch Lambda for a Python script on EC2. (Paying for extra services)
- **Option 2**: Pair up API Gateway and DynamoDB SDK. Get API Gateway to act as the mediator, transforming the Decimal before the JSON sees it. (Too Complex)
- **Option 4**: Move the counter to the front-end with JavaScript. (Not my expertise)
- **Option 5**: Create a different feature altogether that still uses Lambda and DynamoDB...

## Project Votes 🗳️
In the end, I chose option 5 because I was sacrificing simplicity for 'wow' factor when i ultimately want to demonstrate function. So I'm currently working on a feature ive called "Project Votes", a system that adds an interactive element to the portfolio, allowing visitors to simply vote as a way to engage with the website as more projects get added. It's currently in the works. Stay tuned. 👨‍💻
